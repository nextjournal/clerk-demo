# Publishing to Github Pages

Clerks function `nextjournal.clerk/build-static-app!` takes a map with `:paths` and builds a static html page of your notebooks at such paths.  

To publish a collection of clerk notebooks to github pages (like this guide) we suggest adding a `:nextjournal/clerk` alias to your repo's `deps.edn` with e.g. the following properties:

    {:extra-deps {io.github.nextjournal/clerk {:git/sha "13ba371a894aa8696697d0a47cf715296c35e4b5"}}
     :extra-paths ["datasets"]
     :exec-fn nextjournal.clerk/build-static-app!
     :exec-args {:paths [.. paths to my notebooks ... ]}}

and a e.g. `.github/workflows/main.yml` to your repo with the following steps:


        name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        
        on:
          push:
            #branches: [master] #uncomment this to only respond to a push to master
        
          # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
          workflow_dispatch:
        
        # Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
        permissions:
          contents: read
          pages: write
          id-token: write
        
        # Allow one concurrent deployment
        concurrency:
          group: "pages"
          cancel-in-progress: true
        
        jobs:
          # Build job
