# SciCloj Clerk Workshop Setup

Thanks for joining this Clerk workshop! We've prepared a handful of
exercises for you to work through at your own pace first, then we will
talk about them in the meeting. If you get stuck, feel free to reach
out on the slack. There's also no pressure to solve everything, but
you'll get most out of it if you at least try.

1. Git clone https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk-demo
2. Checkout the `workshop-202210-scicloj` branch
3. Follow the instructions in README.md to get started
4. Work through the exercies in the `workshop/exercices` directory

The ðŸ““ [Book of
Clerk](https://github.clerk.garden/nextjournal/book-of-clerk/commit/32451f85976ff5e0bc18941f42e1d3e8ce859640/)
should be a helpful resource.

We also recommend setting up a ðŸ”ª [hotkey in your
editor](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk#editor-workflow). If the
editor you're using, isn't on the list, please let us know on the
Slack.

Thank you, looking forward to see you all Thursday!
