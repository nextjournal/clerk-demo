# StrangeLoop Workshop Setup

The workshop is intended for intermediate and advanced Clojure
programmers. So we assume you've got [clojure
installed](https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure) know how to
start a Clojure project so you can have an editor connected REPL. If
you're unsure or need help here, please reach out to us in
`#workshop-clerk-moldable-development` on the StrangeLoop slack!

Before the workshop we ask you to please:

1. Join `#workshop-clerk-moldable-development` on the
   StrangeLoop slack
2. Git clone https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk-demo
3. Make sure you can run it and evaluate forms in `user.clj`
4. Run and play a bit with at least three of the following notebooks
    - `introduction.clj`
    - `data_science.clj`
    - `semantic.clj`
    - `rule_30.clj`
    - `zipper_with_scars.clj`
    
We recommend reading over them with your editor and browser
side-by-side so you can explore what Clerk is doing at the REPL.

If you find yourself with more time on your hands:

- Read the ðŸ““ [Book of Clerk](https://snapshots.nextjournal.com/clerk/build/48574b57e77d29b28cc158b9e747e943d15757d6/book.html)

- try setting up a ðŸ”ª [hotkey in your
editor](https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk#editor-workflow). If the
editor you're using, isn't on the list, please let us know on the
Slack.

- Git clone https://github.com/nextjournal/clerk

If you have any other questions or suggestions, please do
let us know. We're looking forward to see you.
